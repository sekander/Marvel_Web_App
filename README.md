Here's a summary of everything you've done so far with your C# ASP.NET Core project:
1. Project Setup

    You started by creating an ASP.NET Core project with Identity for user authentication.
    Configured MySQL with the Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql provider to store application data, including users, roles, and login information.

2. Identity Setup

    Added ASP.NET Core Identity with custom ApplicationUser class, extending IdentityUser for additional user properties (if needed).
    Configured SignInManager<ApplicationUser> and UserManager<ApplicationUser> in the AccountController to handle user login and registration.

3. Database Initialization

    Created a DbInitializer class to seed initial data, including creating roles like "Admin", "Manager", and "User" and assigning default users (Admin, Manager, and User).
    Applied the database migrations to initialize the schema and roles in MySQL.
    Ensured that roles and default users were created during application startup.

4. Login and Authentication

    Created LoginViewModel to accept user credentials (email and password) in the login view.
    Implemented the Login action in the AccountController to authenticate users:
        Checked for valid credentials with SignInManager.PasswordSignInAsync.
        Based on roles ("Admin", "Manager", "User"), redirected users to their respective dashboards.

5. Dashboard View

    Developed a Dashboard view that shows different content based on the user's role.
        Admin has full access to the application.
        Manager has limited access compared to Admin.
        User has access to a basic user dashboard.

6. Login Form (Razor View)

    Designed the Login Razor view (Login.cshtml) with fields for email and password.
    Added form validation and anti-forgery token to prevent CSRF attacks.

7. Redirect Logic and Error Handling

    Upon successful login, the user is redirected to their respective dashboard based on their role.
    If the login fails (invalid credentials or non-existent user), error messages are displayed in the view.
    Handled errors such as "Invalid login attempt" and "User does not exist".

8. Role-based Authentication and Authorization

    Implemented role-based redirects after login, where users are redirected based on their assigned roles (Admin, Manager, or User).
    Ensured each role accesses the correct dashboard with custom content tailored for each role.

9. Routing and Startup Configuration

    Configured routing in the Program.cs to map the login page and fallback routes for unauthenticated users.
    Set up middleware for authentication and authorization.
    Added database migrations and applied them to create the necessary tables for users, roles, and related information.

Summary of Next Steps:

    Verify the login functionality by testing different users with different roles.
    Ensure that the database is properly seeded with roles and users.
    Add further views and functionality specific to Admin, Manager, and User dashboards as per the projectâ€™s requirements.
